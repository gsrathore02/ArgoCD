ArgoCD is an open-source declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes. It allows you to maintain, manage, and deploy applications on Kubernetes clusters using Git repositories as the source of truth for configuration. ArgoCD simplifies the process of deploying applications by abstracting away the complexities of manually interacting with Kubernetes APIs and configuration files.

Here's how ArgoCD works and what it offers:

Declarative Configuration: With ArgoCD, you define the desired state of your applications using YAML manifests. These manifests describe the resources you want to deploy, their configuration, and their relationships.

GitOps Workflow: ArgoCD follows the GitOps workflow, which means that your application definitions and configuration are stored in Git repositories. The Git repository becomes the single source of truth for how your applications should be deployed and maintained.

Continuous Delivery: ArgoCD continuously monitors your Git repository for changes. When changes are detected, it compares the current state of the deployed applications with the desired state defined in the repository. If there are differences, ArgoCD automatically synchronizes the cluster to match the desired state.

Application Rollbacks: ArgoCD allows you to easily rollback applications to a previous known state by reverting to a specific commit or version in the Git repository.

Multi-Environment Support: ArgoCD supports deploying applications across multiple environments, such as development, testing, and production. Each environment can have its own configuration, but the overall deployment process remains consistent.

Access Control and Auditing: ArgoCD provides access control mechanisms to ensure that only authorized users have the ability to change application configurations. It also logs and audits changes for security and compliance.

Customizable Hooks: ArgoCD supports pre-sync and post-sync hooks, which allow you to execute custom scripts or commands before and after the synchronization process.

CLI and Web UI: ArgoCD provides both a command-line interface (CLI) and a web-based user interface (UI) for managing applications and their deployments.

ArgoCD is a popular choice for organizations that want to automate their Kubernetes application deployment workflows while maintaining a strong version control and audit trail. It aligns well with the GitOps philosophy of managing infrastructure and applications as code. Keep in mind that my knowledge is based on information available up to September 2021, and there might have been updates or changes to ArgoCD since then.
